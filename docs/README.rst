cpuid is a C++ library for CPU dispatching. Currently the
project can detect the following CPU capabilities:

- Instruction sets detected on x86: FPU, MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3,
  SSE 4.1, SSE 4.2, PCLMULQDQ, AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 extensions.
- Instruction sets detected on ARM: NEON

License
-------
cpuid license is based on the BSD License. Please refer to the LICENSE.rst
file for more details.

Platforms
---------
We have tested cpuid on various versions of Windows, Linux and Mac. We
run automated tests with different compilers like g++, clang and msvc.

Build
-----

Fetch the sources, and we also recommend that you switch to the last released
version of the library:

.. parsed-literal::

  git clone https://github.com/steinwurf/cpuid
  cd cpuid
  git checkout |version|

We use the ``waf`` build system to build the cpuid static library.
We have some additional waf tools which can be found at waf_.

.. _waf: https://github.com/steinwurf/waf

To configure and build cpuid, run the following commands::

  python waf configure
  python waf build
  python waf install --destdir cpuid_install

The final ``install`` step will create a folder containing all the nessecary
files needed to use the library (e.g. static library, headers etc.). You
can change the output folder by passing a different path to ``--destdir``.

When building the libraries, waf will also build the ``print_cpuinfo_example``
executable which is useful to print the available CPU instruction sets.
The compiled binary is located in the ``build/[platform]/examples/print_cpuinfo``
folder (where ``[platform]`` denotes your current platform,
e.g. ``linux``, ``win32`` or ``darwin``).

Use as Dependency in CMake
--------------------------

To depend on this project when using the CMake build system, add the following
in your CMake build script:

::

   add_subdirectory("/path/to/cpuid" cpuid)
   target_link_libraries(<my_target> steinwurf::cpuid)

Where ``<my_target>`` is replaced by your target.

that others may also find it useful. When designing cpuid we found
